# Type Inference in TypeScript

**Type inference** is a powerful feature in TypeScript that automatically specify the type of a variable, function, or expression .

## Why is Type Inference Helpful?
Type inference in TypeScript offers several key benefits:

- **Reduces Boilerplate**: It makes code shorter and cleaner.
- **Maintains Type Safety**:TypeScript will automatically infer the correct type, ensuring benefits of type safety.
- **Improves Readability**: It makes code easy to read and understand.

### Example of Type Inference:

```typescript
let age = 25;          // TypeScript infers `number`
let name = "Soraz";    // TypeScript infers `string`
let isActive = true;   // TypeScript infers `boolean`

```

# How TypeScript Enhances Code Quality & Project Maintenance

TypeScript does more than just add types to JavaScript. It improves the reliability and manageability of your code, making it more stable, easier to scale, and reducing the chance of errors.

## 1. Catching Errors Early
With TypeScript, errors are detected during **compile-time**, not **runtime**. This helps you spot mistakes early. It saves you time and minimizes the risk of bugs in the final product.

## 2. Improved Developer Tools
TypeScript boosts your **coding experience** with features like:
- **Autocompletion**: TypeScript provides suggestions while type.
- **Inline Hints**: It shows  helpful information about the types and structures.
- **Refactoring Support**: When you need to change code, TypeScript automatically updates all the related parts.

## 3. Code That Explains Itself
TypeScript’s code becomes **self-explanatory**. By defining types and interfaces it makes an easy part of explain of code.

## 4. Smoother Refactoring
Changing code in TypeScript is less risky. Its easy to refactoring.

## 5. Scaling  Project
As  project grows, TypeScript ensures that it code remains **consistent** and easy to manage. 

## Conclusion
TypeScript’s is use to write cleaner, more manageable code that’s easier to scale and maintain.TypeScript is a key asset for anyone working on modern JavaScript projects.
